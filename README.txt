NWebSocket-Client
=================
This is a .NET 4 version of Ido Ran's Websocket client implementation.
I've changed the project to .NET4 and added Rx (Reactive Extensions for .NET) to it.
This version handles large streams coming from the server (the original framer seemed to drop every other message or so).

ToDo:
  Add more documentation :)
